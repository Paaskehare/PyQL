PyQL
======================

This is a "*Library*" - if you can call it that - for [Quakelive](http://www.quakelive.com/) made with python, to allow for easily fetching account stats from the profile pages.

It does this with a set of nasty regex expression to achieve the wanted result. I wanted to use a xml parser, but sadly enough the HTML Markup from the quakelive page isn't strictly valid.

Examples of usage can be found in the `examples.py` file.

*Good luck!*
