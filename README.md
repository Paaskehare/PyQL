PyQL
======================

This is a "*Library*" - if you can call it that - that provides a set of easily usable python bindings for the [QuakeLive.com](http://www.quakelive.com/) website - to allow for easily fetching various stats from the website.

Examples of usage can be found in the `examples.py` file.

*Good luck!*
